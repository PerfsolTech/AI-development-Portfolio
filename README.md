**💜Checksum - Test every corner of your app using AI**

[Checksum](https://checksum.ai/) automatically generates and maintains end-to-end tests based on user sessions so you can move fast without breaking things.

**Project overview**
Checksum trains an AI model on real user sessions from your production environment. Our models learn how your users use your app, how they interact with elements, and the typical as well as the edge cases flows they take
Then we connect the model to a browser, give it a username and password, and let it generate tests. Since our model is trained specifically on your software, it executes every edge case and produces automated tests.

⚡️Challenge:Implementing web application features to make user experience easier with artificial intelligence that provides testing of the web applications

🌟Solution:Created new pages that allow to view the large videos that were generated by ai and show them. Added a User-friendly interface (such as was in the design) to switch between projects and tests that were generated and update them.

**🧠Tech Stack**

React.js, typescript, MUI, Redux toolkit query, Emotion.

💜 [Checksum](https://checksum.ai/) Let us worry about testing, so you can focus on shipping!

**Project overview**

📍Implementing Unit Tests:Due to the absence of a reliable testing infrastructure, the software was vulnerable to bugs and regressions. As a result, we needed to create a complex system to check particular components and functions.

📍Implementing End-to-End (E2E) Tests:E2E tests are aimed at checking the behavior of the whole system. They are crucial for avoiding potential problems with usability and covering the most crucial functionality.

📍Adding Filtering, Searching, Editing, and Customization Features:The main goal of this task was to boost user experience and increase loyalty by providing users with more control over their data
